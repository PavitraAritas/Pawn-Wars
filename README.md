## Problem it Solves

- There are no incentives while playing a real-time game which makes it a show-stopper. 
- Players can earn real value for their game skills and time.
- To be a part of a decentralised way of betting environment.

## Challenges we faced

- Diving into blockchain was intimidating, Solidity has a high learning curve.
- Building mobile first web3 app was hard because of lack of tooling           
- We started out short on time which made it very hard and challenging to integrate many features and building a functional app.
- Building a chess gaming app with betting feature using web3 was demanding because of the complex logic
- Integrating multiple third-party services like StackOS, filecoin and MATIC was the trickiest part.
